CYAN was my final year capstone project. I'm very proud of what I managed to achieve with it so far.
See final report pdf for in-depth information about the project, and feedback.txt for the glowing feedback recived after submission.

CYAN is a writer/reader that you can use to make and play "Choose Your Own Adventure"(CYOA)-style games. CYAN allows you, with no programming experience, to create CYOA games via the Writer GUI, and for someone else to play through your adventures using the Reader GUI. 

CYAN boasts a versatile input system to give you maximum creative control over what your player sees, allowing for dynamically interchanged description paragraphs, and user choice options, while being simple enough to pick up and use within mere minutes.
